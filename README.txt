This Config uses assets from comalgias config while retaining all the binds I use. This config will also try to make the maximum fps rate for your computer







To use said config, Extract the Cfg folder into your tf folder 

To get to said folder navigate through: Program files(x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf

once loading tf2, the game will redirect you to tr_walkway. It may take a few seconds since there is a short delay.

If it is not loading, click the link in my website to download tr_walkway. Extract the map into the maps folder in the /tf/ directory


Thank you for installing my config! I will release fix notes for my config on my website. Thanks!
